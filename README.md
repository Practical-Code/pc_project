Two page website set up with Page #1 acting as the home page with links to 'Home' and 'WebAppForm', 
and Page #2 acting as the form page with links to 'Home' and 'WebAppForm' which allows a user to input a quote, 
which will then be retained in a database and will appear on page. 
Revisiting the 'WebAppForm' page, the quote will then appear in a visual history of user inputs.
